# GSM-RL78-PCB
![3D PCB View](./rl78-lfqfp48-rev-1.3/rl78-gsm.png)

- Designed using KiCAD PCB Design SW.
- GSM modem Interface to RL78 uC using AT-MODEM commands over UART. Using this, we can build 2G/3G/4G wireless automation device. 
    - For example: to switch a remote high power motors, to monitor status using SMS/phone call. 
- The embedded C code to issue GSM AT Commands is available in another repo in my same gitHub account.

I plan to write a better documentation on my personal site:
